**Project Backup and Security Guidelines**

**1. Overview**
The purpose of this document is to outline best practices and steps to ensure the security and support of project backups and sensitive data. Regular creation and proper management of backups are crucial for the long-term reliability and security of the system.

**2. Directory Structure for Backups**
Backups are organized in the following structure to simplify management and access:

```
/media/sf_ShareFolder/backups/
  ├── sql_backups/
  ├── config/
  │     ├── apache/
  │     └── mysql/
  ├── logs/
```
- **sql_backups/**: Contains database backups, ensuring the preservation of critical data and allowing for recovery when needed.
- **config/apache/** & **config/mysql/**: Contains configuration files for Apache and MySQL services.
- **logs/**: Stores log files for tracking system events and debugging.

**3. Backup Frequency**
Backups should be performed regularly to minimize the risk of data loss. The recommended backup schedule:

- **SQL Backups**: Every 5 days or after significant project updates.
- **Configuration Files**: Immediately after changes are made to Apache or MySQL configurations.
- **Logs**: Automatically collected and periodically reviewed for anomalies.

**4. Security Best Practices**
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to backup files and directories. Use appropriate file permissions to restrict access.
- **Environment Security**: Regularly review the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental uploading of sensitive information to version control systems like GitHub.
- **Password Protection**: If backups contain sensitive data, consider encrypting backup files with a strong password.
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly audit backup scripts and files to ensure that sensitive information is not accessible to unauthorized individuals.

**5. Automatic Backup Script**
To simplify backup management, an automated script should be created to perform the following tasks:
- Create database backups and save them in the `sql_backups/` directory.
- Copy updated configuration files to the respective directories.
- Set appropriate file permissions for each backup file.
- Log activities in the `logs/` directory.

**6. Documentation Update**
This document, stored in `Docs/safety/`, should be regularly updated whenever changes are made to backup procedures or new risks are identified. Periodic reviews ensure that all backup practices align with the latest security recommendations.

**7. Future Improvements**
- **Encryption**: Automate the encryption of sensitive backup files to enhance security.
- **Cloud Storage**: Explore cloud backup solutions to provide redundancy and facilitate easy recovery in case of local system failures.
